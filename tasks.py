                Consider consulting or collaborating with the researcher at various stages of the writing process:

                1. **Concept Development:** When developing the initial concept for a story, especially if it involves complex scientific or technological elements, consulting a researcher can provide valuable insights and ensure accuracy in portraying scientific concepts.

                2. **World-Building:** For creating believable and immersive fictional worlds, collaborating with experts in fields such as astronomy, physics, biology, or engineering can help ensure consistency and plausibility in the depiction of futuristic technologies, environments, or societies.

                3. **Fact-Checking:** During the writing process, it's essential to fact-check scientific details to maintain credibility. Consulting with a researcher can help verify the accuracy of scientific concepts, terminology, and principles used in the story.

                4. **Problem-Solving:** If the narrative encounters scientific or technical challenges that require creative solutions, collaborating with a researcher can provide valuable perspectives and help brainstorm realistic and innovative resolutions.
